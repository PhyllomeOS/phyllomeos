# What ? When flattened, this file will result in a stand-alone kickstart file that can be automatically deploy into a server-oriented system.

# In order to be fed to virt-install or a software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flattened.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c dev-virtual-server.cfg -o ../leaves/dev-virtual-server.cfg

%include base-fedora-repo.cfg # offical repositories for Fedora
%include base-storage.cfg # base storage
%include dev-base.cfg # A base system
%include base-guest-agents.cfg # Guest agents

reboot --kexec # Reboot straight into the system after a successfull installation
