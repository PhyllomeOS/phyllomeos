# What ? When flattened, this file will result in a stand-alone kickstart file that can be automatically deploy into a server-oriented system with a hypervisor optimized for Intel (tm) CPUs and Intel(tm) GPUs compatible with vfio-mdev (pre-Tiger Lake)

# In order to be fed to virt-install or software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flatten or merged into one.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c server-hypervisor-intelcpu-intelgpu.cfg -o ../leaves/phyllome-server-intelcpu-intelgpu.cfg

%include base-fedora-repo.cfg # offical repositories for Fedora
%include base-storage.cfg # base storage
%include base.cfg # A minimal machine
%include base-hypervisor.cfg # A base hypervisor
%include base-hypervisor-intelcpu.cfg # Specific virtualization configuration for Intel (tm) CPUs
%include base-hypervisor-intelgpu.cfg # Specific virtualization configuration for Intel (tm) GPUs from 4th to the 9th generation (compatible with vfio-mdev).
%include base-initial-setup.cfg # Includes initial-setup so on first-boot a new user can be created

reboot --kexec # Reboot straight into the system after a successfull installation
