# What ? This kickstart file bootstraps a live desktop hypervisor configured for AMD (tm) CPUs.
# 'l' for live, 'd' for desktop, 'h' for hypervisor', 'a' for amd, 'm' for minimal, 'd' for development only.

# ATTENTION : this kickstart file will automatically DESTROY the main disk and all of its contents. 
# Bye bye!

# In order to be fed to virt-install or software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flatten or merged into one.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c ldhamd.cfg -o flat-ldhamd.cfg

# An ISO file can be created using the following command as *root*:  
# livecd-creator -c flat-ldhamd.cfg --fslabel=ldhamd
# livecd-creator is part of the livecd-tools package

# The resulting ISO can be tested with qemu-kvm, using the following command as *root*:
# qemu-kvm -m 2048 -vga virtio -display gtk,gl=on ldhamd.iso
