# What ? This kickstart file bootstraps a live desktop hypervisor configured for Intel(tm) CPU and Intel(tm) Graphics.
# 'l' for live, 'd' for desktop, 'h' for hypervisor, 'i' for intel, 'm' for minimal, 'd' for development only.

# ATTENTION : this kickstart file will automatically DESTROY the main disk and all of its contents. 
# Bye bye!

# In order to be fed to virt-install or software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flatten or merged into one.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c ldhimd.cfg -o flat-ldhimd.cfg

%include ldhmd.cfg # A live desktop hypervisor machine
%include bimd.cfg # Specific virtualization configuration for Intel(tm) CPU and Intel(tm) Graphics
