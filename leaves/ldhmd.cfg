# What ? This kickstart file bootstraps a desktop hypervisor based on Fedora 34 expecting Intel(tm) CPU and Intel(tm) Graphics.
# 'l' for live, 'd' for desktop, 'h' for hypervisor, 'm' for minimal, 'd' for development only.

# ATTENTION : this kickstart file will automatically DESTROY the main disk and all of its contents. 
# Bye bye!

%include blmd.cfg # A base for a minimal live machine based on Fedora 34.
%include bdmd.cfg # A desktop machine based on Fedora 34
%include bhmd.cfg # A base hypervisor based on Fedora 34

xconfig --startxonboot --defaultdesktop=GNOME # Start GNOME on boot. Althought it says X, it works as well with Wayland
