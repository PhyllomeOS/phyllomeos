# What ? This kickstart file automatically deploys a minimal system.
# 'm' for minimal, 'd' for development only.

# Know bug: Cannot resolve host name

# ATTENTION : this kickstart file will automatically DESTROY the main disk and all of its contents. 
# Bye bye!

# In order to be fed to virt-install or software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flatten or merged into one.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c bmd.cfg -o flat-bmd.cfg

%include bmd.cfg # A base system

firstboot --enable --reconfig # Initial Setup will start after the first reboot
reboot --kexec # Reboot straight into the system after a successfull installation

%packages --exclude-weakdeps # Beginning of the packages section. Do not include weak dependencies.

initial-setup # Install the initial setup package.

%end # End of the packages section
