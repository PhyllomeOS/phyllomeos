# What ? This kickstart file bootstraps a desktop hypervisor configured for AMD (tm) CPUs.

# In order to be fed to virt-install or software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flatten or merged into one.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c desktop-hypervisor-amdcpu.cfg -o ../dishes/phyllome-desktop-amdcpu.cfg

# to flatten all the files in the recipes repository, to the following
# for filename in *.cfg; do ksflatten -c "$filename" -o "../dishes/$filename"; done
