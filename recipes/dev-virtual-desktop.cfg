# FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY!
# What ? This kickstart file bootstraps a desktop machine using GNOME Shell meant to be used as a virtual machine.

# In order to be fed to virt-install or software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flatten or merged into one.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c dev-virtual-desktop.cfg -o ../dishes/dev-virtual-desktop.cfg

%include ../ingredients/base-fedora-repo.cfg # offical repositories for Fedora
%include ../ingredients/base-storage.cfg # base storage
%include ../ingredients/dev-base.cfg # A minimal machine
%include ../ingredients/base-desktop-gnome.cfg # A desktop environment
%include ../ingredients/base-guest-agents.cfg # Guest agents

reboot --kexec # Reboot straight into the system after a successfull installation
