# What ? When flattened, this file will result in a stand-alone kickstart file that can be automatically deploy into a server-oriented system.

# In order to be fed to virt-install or a software like livecd-creator, this file needs to be flattened.
# Here is how you can do it with the ksflatten tool provided by the pykickstart package on Fedora :
# ksflatten -c dev-virtual-server.cfg -o ../dishes/dev-virtual-server.cfg

%include ../ingredients/base-fedora-repo.cfg # offical repositories for Fedora
%include ../ingredients/base-storage.cfg # base storage
%include ../ingredients/dev-base.cfg # A base system
%include ../ingredients/base-guest-agents.cfg # Guest agents

poweroff # Shut down the system after a successful installation
